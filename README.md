# Ilanya Trait Engine

A sophisticated neural network-based trait engine for cognitive AI systems, designed to model, process, and evolve personality traits and behavioral patterns.

## Overview

The Ilanya Trait Engine is a PyTorch-based neural network system that:
- Models complex personality traits and their interactions
- Processes behavioral patterns and cognitive states
- Provides trait evolution and adaptation mechanisms
- Supports multi-modal trait representation
- Enables real-time trait processing for AI agents

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Trait Neural Network**: Multi-layered neural network for trait processing
- **Trait Embeddings**: Vector representations of personality traits
- **Trait Evolution Engine**: Mechanisms for trait adaptation and learning
- **Trait Interaction Matrix**: Modeling trait relationships and dependencies
- **Cognitive State Processor**: Real-time cognitive state analysis

### Neural Network Structure
- **Input Layer**: Multi-modal trait inputs (behavioral, cognitive, environmental)
- **Hidden Layers**: Transformer-based attention mechanisms for trait relationships
- **Output Layer**: Trait predictions, confidence scores, and evolution signals
- **Memory Components**: Long-term trait memory and short-term state tracking

## Features

- **Multi-Modal Trait Processing**: Handles various types of trait data
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Dynamic trait evolution based on experiences
- **Trait Relationship Modeling**: Complex interactions between different traits
- **Memory Integration**: Long-term and short-term trait memory systems
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for high-performance AI agent integration
- **Rust Portability**: Architecture designed for future Rust implementation

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from trait_engine import TraitEngine
from trait_models import TraitNeuralNetwork

# Initialize the trait engine
engine = TraitEngine()

# Create a trait neural network
trait_nn = TraitNeuralNetwork(
    input_dim=512,
    hidden_dim=1024,
    num_layers=6,
    num_heads=8
)

# Process trait data
traits = engine.process_traits(input_data)
evolved_traits = engine.evolve_traits(traits, experience_data)
```
